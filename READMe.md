# **IMPORTANT**
This does not move the songs to the recycle bin. It just deletes them. 
I recommend backing up your songs folder just in case.
# Using A Custom Song Folder Path
using node:
`node BeatmapCleaner.js C:/path/to/your/songs`
using the executable:
`BeatmapCleaner.exe C:/path/to/your/songs`
# Farm Maps
If you want to remove a song from the list of farm maps, simply edit the defaults.txt and remove the keyword.
# Contributing
If you feel I missed an important map, or want to make a contribution, please create a pull request.
